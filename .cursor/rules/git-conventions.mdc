## Language policy
- English for both branch name and commit message

## Commit Message Format
- must follow conventional commit message format. Refer to [conventional commit message format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

1. fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
2. feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
3. BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
4. types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
5. footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Example
```
feat: add new feature
```

```
fix: fix bug
```

```
refactor: refactor code
```

```
test: add test
```

```
feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```
