### General rules
- Only comment things that have business logic complexity.
- Comments are an apology, not a requirement. Good code mostly documents itself.

### Format
- Must start with a lowercase character and without a period at the end.
- When there are multiple steps, please use the following format:
```
Step 1: check cache
Step 2: validate response
```
