#### Task type
UI improvement

#### Fix the following issues: 
1. When users visit post page, they should be able to go back to the previous page by clicking the back button.

2. In `JournalSection.tsx`, when users hover over the post, the post should be highlighted (or any ui improvement you can think of)

3. In `JournalSection.tsx`, remove the publish type from the post

4. When users click the post, it should show some loading ui before the post is loaded.

Please fix them one by one, and commit them separately.
